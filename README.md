##The CRP Group site update 2013

The CRP Group is an entertainment design agency located in Burbank, CA. As part of my time working there, I took on many web design and development jobs for an assortment of clients, culminating is a redesign of their company site. 

It was important that the site be clean, follow the company's branding and voice, and be easy to keep up to date. As part of my first forray into MV*, I settled on using BackboneJS to build out the individual project items on the main page, and their associated modal views. The models for each project presented are populated from a JSON file, which can be easily edited to add or remove projects from the page.

A good amount of time was also spent working with CSS media queries to keep the site responsive and looking clean on all types of mobile devices.

As part of an upcomig update, I am working to transfer the project data from being served via JSON to being persisted and served by a MySQL database, with a simple client facing interface for handling the adding, editing and removing projects.
